# NStack .NET SDK
Use this SDK to interact with NStack. This SDK contains injectable services to get translations etc. from NStack.

## Installation
The SDK is available from the NuGet gallery. The package is called `Monstarlab.NStack.SDK`, you can install it by searching for it or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console

```PowerShell
Install-Package Monstarlab.NStack.SDK
```

Or if you're using the dotnet CLI, run the following command:

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Monstarlab.NStack.SDK
```

## Configuration
The configuration is stored in the class `NStackConfiguration` which have three properties:
- ApiKey
- ApplicationId
- BaseUrl

All information can be found in the NStack portal

## Interfaces
Every service is implemented using the interface approach to make dependency injection as smooth as possible.

### INStackRepository
This interface handles the REST communication with the NStack server. The built in implementation of the interface is `NStackRepository` which takes `NStackConfiguration` as a constructor parameter. The exposed functions are for use by the service layer.

### INStackAppService
This interface is to be used for your normal translation needs. The constructor for the built in implementation has an optional parameter called `howOftenToCheckInMinutes` which defines how often the get resource methods should check NStack for updated versions of the localizations. By default it's 5 minutes.

#### AppOpenAsync
This function fetches localization and terms metadata from NStack. The method returns `DataAppOpenWrapper`.

##### ResourceItem
ResourceItem is an implementation of `ConcurrentDictionary<string, ResourceInnerItem>` which can be extended to get strongly typed sections for your translation. The `Translation generator` tool can be used to generate these files automatically.

This class holds the translation sections and can be used by either extending the class or just use the class as is as a normal dictionary e.g. `item["mySection"]`.

##### ResourceInnerItem
ResourceInnerItem is an implemenation of `ConcurrentDictionary<string, string>` which can be extended in the same manner as `ResourceItem`. This class holds the actual translations and can be used by either extending the class or just use the class as is as a normal dictionary e.g. `innerItem["myTranslation"]`.

#### GetDefaultResourceAsync
This function returns the default language for the provided platform. The method returns `DataMetaWrapper<T> where T : ResourceItem`.

## DI setup
The SDK is built with DI support in mind and can be quickly set up in your `startup.cs` file in `ConfigureServices`:

```C#
services.AddSingleton<NStackConfiguration>(r => new NStackConfiguration
{
    ApiKey = "MyApiKey",
    ApplicationId = "MyApplicationId",
    BaseUrl = "MyBaseUrl"
});

// The memory cache is used by the app service.
services.AddMemoryCache();

services.AddTransient<INStackRepository, NStackRepository>();
services.AddTransient<INStackLocalizeService, NStackLocalizeService>();
services.AddTransient<INStackTermsService, NStackTermsService>();
services.AddTransient<INStackAppService, NStackAppService>();
```

Best practice is to not hard code the configuration values but to fetch them from your application settings. If `BaseUrl` isn't set, it will default to `https://nstack.io`. The rest of the properties does not have any default values.

## Translation generator
The translation generator is a tool which can access your NStack translation and generate C# classes based on the JSON response from a specified resource.

Currently the tool is only available for use in Windows. The tool is downloaded along with the NuGet package in `packages/NStack.SDK/{version}/NStackTranslationGenerator/NStackTranslationGenerator.exe`.
